          <h2>What is Cannibis? by reddit user FUBO</h2>
          <p>"Marijuana" is a special word for the common hemp plant, or cannabis — which is a plant that has been used for thousands of years for a lot of different things; such as rope, fabric, paper, oil, and drugs. The word "marijuana" or "marihuana" used to be a rare slang expression, but government people in the early 20th century started using it a lot in order to make hemp sound more foreign, and to make it sound scary to people who didn't like foreign things.
    
    When people smoke or eat the buds or resin of the hemp plant, it does a bunch of different things to them. The most obvious is that it usually makes people feel good. Depending on the kind of hemp and the person doing it, it can make people feel happy, excited, relaxed, and a bit dizzy. It can make music sound prettier, make colors seem brighter, and make silly things funnier.
    
    On the other hand, it can also sometimes make people scared or overwhelmed and unhappy. And other people think it makes them lazy or boring. People are different, and while some people like the effects of cannabis a lot, others don't. That's normal — just as some people really like the taste of olives or broccoli or red wine or blue cheese, and others really dislike them.
    
    Hemp does other things, too. One is that it usually makes people a little bit hungry — you might have heard of this as "the munchies". This same effect helps keep people from throwing up if they are sick. This is why many people with AIDS or cancer use cannabis — because the medicines they take for AIDS or cancer are very powerful and make them throw up, but the hemp helps stop that.</p>

          <h2>Cannabis can help sickness?</h2>
            <p>The plausible beneficial effects of medical marijuana include: improvement of chronic pain, reduced nausea and vomiting, reduced spasticity, improvements in glaucoma, treatment for epilepsy.
    
    In terms of improving pain, nausea, vomiting: This useful JAMA meta-analysis notes:
    
        Compared with placebo, cannabinoids were associated with a greater average number of patients showing:
    
            Complete nausea and vomiting response (47% vs 20%; odds ratio [OR], 3.82 [95% CI, 1.55-9.42]; 3 trials)
    
            Reduction in pain (37% vs 31%; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.99-2.00]; 8 trials)
    
            Greater average reduction in numerical rating scale pain assessment (on a 0-10-point scale; weighted mean difference [WMD], −0.46 [95% CI, −0.80 to −0.11]; 6 trials)
    
            Reduction in the Ashworth spasticity scale (WMD, −0.12 [95% CI, −0.24 to 0.01]; 5 trials).
    
    Treatment of chronic pain, improvements in nausea and vomiting, and increased appetite are moderately well documented uses of medical marijuana. This penumbra of health benefits makes medical marijuana symptomatically useful in the treatment of HIV/AIDS wasting disease, chemotherapy response, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain, though other treatments are also available.
    
    Other proposed uses of medical marijuana include treatment for glaucoma and treatment for epilepsy.
    
    Medical marijuana can reduce intra-ocular pressure in humans associated with glaucoma, but other medical treatments are likely superior. (1)(2)
    
    Currently knowledge of marijuana use in epilepsy is limited to small surveys in humans and mice. However phase III clinical trials are underway further exploring the potential for cannabinoids to treat this condition (and many others).</p>

          <p>When it comes to finding the right medical marijuana strain type, the best thing you can do is speak with your doctor. They should be able to make specific recommendations based on your condition. When you visit a dispensary or clinic to purchase your medication, you might also receive expert recommendations simply by being candid about the result you hope to achieve. </p>
